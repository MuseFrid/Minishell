## Todo
#### Builtins :
*All builtins must be incorporated with the right value of our structure !*
- [ ] - echo (not finished, must manage environemental variable and have a better logic).
- [x] - cd
- [x] - unset
- [x] - export
- [x] - exit
- [x] - env
- [x] - pwd

#### Executor :
Not yet started

----------

- [x] Maybe change the logic with environemental variable to stock in the struct with `key` to have the name of the variable and `value` to have the value. Not have all the `key` `value` in one variable.
